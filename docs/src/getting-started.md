## Setting up the Docker Container

The simplest way to run models is to use one of the Docker images. There are two Docker images you can use to set up your environment:

* **Base Image**: This image includes all the necessary dependencies.
    * ghcr.io/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe/tt-forge-fe-base-ird-ubuntu-22-04
* **Prebuilt Environment Image**: This image contains all necessary dependencies and a prebuilt environment.
    * ghcr.io/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe/tt-forge-fe-ird-ubuntu-22-04

To install, do the following:

1. Install Docker if you do not already have it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

2. Test that docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
```

3. Add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

4. Run the container (the prebuilt image is used here):

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe/tt-forge-fe-ird-ubuntu-22-04
```

5. If you want to check that it's running, open a new tab with the **Same Command** option and run the following:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Installing Depencencies

Inside the running Docker container, install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-dev \
    python3-venv \
    python3-pip \
    libhwloc-dev \
    libtbb-dev \
    libcapstone-dev \
    graphviz \
    libgl1 \
    libglx-mesa0
```

## Creating a Virtual Environment
It is recommended that you install a virtual environment for the wheel you want to work with. Wheels from different repos may have conflicting dependencies.

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3s -m venv name-of-environment-venv
source name-of-environment/bin/activate
```

## Installing a Wheel
This section walks you through downloading and installing a wheel. You can install the wheel wherever you would like if it's for running a model. If you want to do development work, you must clone the repo you want, navigate into it, and then set up the wheel.

1. Make sure you are in an active virtual environment.

> **NOTE**: If you plan to do development work, before continuing with these instructions, clone the repo you plan to use, then navigate into the repo. If you are just running models, this step is not necessary.

2. Download the wheel(s) you want to use from the [Tenstorrent Nightly Releases](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/releases) page.

For this walkthrough, tt-forge-fe is used. You need to install two wheels for set up:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/releases/download/0.1.0.dev20250422214451/forge-0.1.0.dev20250422214451-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

```bash
pip install https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/releases/download/0.1.0.dev20250422214451/tvm-0.1.0.dev20250422214451-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

> **NOTE:** The commands are examples, for the latest install link, go to the
> [Tenstorrent Nightly Releases](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/releases)
> page. The generic download will be:
> `https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/releases/download/0.1.0.devDATE/
> NAMEOFWHEEL`
>
> If you plan to work with wheels from different repositories, make a separate
> environment for each one. Some wheels have conflicting dependencies.

## Running a Demo

To run a demo, do the following:

1. Clone the tt-forge repo (alternatively, you can download the script for the model you want to try):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge.git
```

2. Navigate to tt-forge/demos/tt-forge-fe.

3. Choose one of the available demos. At this time, you can try:

| Model | Model Type | Description | Demo Code |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------|
| MobileNetV2 | CNN | Lightweight convolutional neural network for efficient image classification | [`cnn/mobile_netv2_demo.py`](cnn/mobile_netv2_demo.py) |
| ResNet-50 | CNN | Deep residual network for image classification | [`cnn/resnet_50_demo.py`](cnn/resnet_50_demo.py) |
| ResNet-50 (ONNX) | CNN | Deep residual network for image classification using ONNX format | [`cnn/resnet_onnx_demo.py`](cnn/resnet_onnx_demo.py) |
| BERT | NLP | Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for natural language understanding tasks | [`nlp/bert_demo.py`](nlp/bert_demo.py) |

4. Run the selected script. As an example, this walkthrough uses the [ResNet 50 Demo](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge/blob/main/demos/tt-forge-fe/cnn/resnet_50_demo.py) script. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 resnet_50_demo.py
```

If all goes well, you should see an image of a tiger, and terminal output where the model predicts what the image is and presents a score indicating how confident it is in its prediction.
