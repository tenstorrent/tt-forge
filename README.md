TT-Forge is our compiler project aimed at utitlizing our latest [tt-mlir](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-mlir) project, a continuation of our work in [tt-buda](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-buda) which is represented in our [Forge Front End Project](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe). Forge also aims to work with Third Party front end frameworks such as XLA which can be seen in [tt-xla](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-xla).   


Project goals
-----
- Provide abstraction of many different frontend frameworks
- Generically compile many kinds of model architectures without modification and with good performance
- Abstract all Tenstorrent device architectures
